## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Example

```JS

Example 1

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011 (n = number equivalent to this binary)
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000 (n = number equivalent to this binary)
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
