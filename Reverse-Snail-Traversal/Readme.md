## Intuition

Reverse Engineering ðŸ˜‰

## Approach

    Since we know that for each snail traverse we need to move from top to bottom and bottom to top
    So here we have maintained 2 counter, row and col, so if the col is even then we need to traverse from top to bottom and if col is odd we need to traverse from bottom to top
    So accordingly based on previous thought process, incrementing and decrementing row counter accordingly

## Complexity

    - Time complexity: O(n)

    - Space complexity: o(1)
